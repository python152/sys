## Format Disks


List all supported file systems:

```
	# diskutil listFilesystems

	# diskutil eraseDisk ExFAT D18B /dev/disk3

	// Journaled, MacOS Extended.

    # diskutil eraseDisk JHFSX D18B /dev/disk3

## Install Xcode Toolchain

Open App Store and Install xcode first.
Open up terminal and run: `xcode-select --install`. This will install command line tools such as git.
If you need to re-install this for some reason:

    sudo mv /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools.old



## Fix blurred fonts after upgrading to Mojave


Problem: after upgrading to this version, the display font (from VS code) seem blurred and fuzzy.

```
# defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO
```

and reboot.

## Setup Shared Time Machine


* On the “Hub Mac”, where this is the server (data.local), attached the volume,
  it must be formatted as Mac OS Extended, Case Sensitive, and Journaled File
  system.

* set up the time machine for the server host (data.local). Created a folder on
  the target volume, let’s call it “Shared Time Machine”. Make this folder
  “shared” 

* Right click on the “shared Time Machine”, and look for “Advanced Options”.

* Here you should check “Share as a Time Machine backup destination”, this will
  make it eligible for backup on other Macs.


## My Current Backup List


* data.local: this is the data server (Plex)
* pico.local: this is the Mac Mini machine I am using as the desktop 
* pi.local: this is the Mac Pro 13 laptop
